# Python Program to find the area of a triangle

# Given base and height (you can modify these values)
base = 5
height = 6

# take inputs from the user
base = float(input('Enter the base length: '))
height = float(input('Enter the height: '))

# Calculate the area
area = 0.5 * base * height

# Print the result
print(f'The area of the triangle is {area:.2f}')
